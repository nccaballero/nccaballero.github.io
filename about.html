<h2>Pastoral Council Info</h2>
<h3>What is it?</h3> 
 <p>A parish pastoral council is the chief consultative body to the pastor. Consultation is
a sharing of wisdom that enables the parish to carry out its mission. The pastoral council 
discerns issues that impact the lives of parishioners; prays, studies, and discusses those 
issues; and recommends practical ways of addressing them.</p> 
 
<h3>Why should a parish have a pastoral council?</h3>
 <p>By baptism and confirmation the laity share in the priestly mission of Christ and are 
empowered to participate in decisions regarding the work of the church. As the "wisdom 
community" of the parish, the council listens to the spiritual needs of parishioners and 
exercises stewardship of the gifts of the parish. The parish pastoral council shares 
responsibility with the pastor for building up the faith community.</p>

<h3>How does a parish pastoral council operate?</h3> 
 <p>A council meets once a month with the pastor to consider pastoral issues. It listens 
carefully to the concerns of the pastor, the parish staff and others involved in the life 
of the parish. Through prayer and discernment it searches for the guidance of the Holy 
Spirit and reaches decisions through consensus. Generally, a Parish Pastoral Council meets
 each month for approximately two hours. Regular attendance at meetings is critical.</p> 
 
<h3>Who should be a member of a parish pastoral council?</h3> 
 <p>A council member should be at least 21 years of age, prayerful, care about the spiritual 
well-being of the entire community, be willing to learn about the church, have a sense of 
mission: to bring Christ to people and people to Christ, and be involved in the life and 
activities of the parish. A council member must be able to attend meetings on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>How is a parish pastoral council formed?</h3>
 <p>Most Parish Pastoral Councils use a four-step process to form the parish pastoral council. 
This process includes prayer, education, discernment and commitment.</p>
<h4>Step 1:</h4> 
 <p>Prayer: Each meeting of the council begins and ends with a prayer experience as 
we focus on our baptismal call to build the kingdom of God. Everyone is asked to pray for 
wisdom and openness for our parishioners and our pastor.</p>  
<h4>Step 2:</h4> 
 <p>Education: Interested parishioners are educated during an Information Meeting for 
those who want to learn more about serving on the council. Anyone can come or recommend 
someone to come to this meeting.</p> 
<h4>Step 3:</h4> 
 <p>Discernment: Next a Discernment Meeting is held for those invited by the pastor. 
The people in attendance consider the gifts and talents of each person and discern who is 
being called by the Holy Spirit to serve at this time. Those interested in being considered 
for discernment must attend the Information Meeting.</p> 
<h4>Step 4:</h4> 
 <p>Commitment: The final step to the process is the blessing of new council members
during the weekend Masses. Then the work of the council begins as members gather information
about the needs and desires of the parishioners and undertake the development of immediate, 
short-term and long-term goals.</p>
